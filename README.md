## Installation

To install backup your .emacs.d directory or .emacs file, move to another directory or remove and then type the following into your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Tunkert/bullshark-macs ~/.emacs.d
```

After running that fire up Emacs - you might get some warnings ... (work in progress)

To get the doom-modeline to work properly run the command:

```
all-the-icons-install-fonts
```

This will install the fonts necessary for the modeline.
